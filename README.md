Day-1 => Writing and Running a Rust Program
         make a new source file and call it main.rs. Rust files always end with the .rs extension.
         Now open the main.rs file you just created and enter the code written in Day-1 main.rs file.
         Save the file and go back to your terminal window. On Linux or macOS, enter the following commands to compile and run the file:
         
         $ rustc main.rs
         $ ./main
           Hello rust! (Output)
         
         
         On Windows, enter the command .\main.exe instead of ./main:
         > rustc main.rs
         > .\main.exe
           Hello rust!  (Output)
